# My .files

I try to keep my setup simple, using only whatever is necessary without adding too much overhead.
My philosophy is to use whatever makes me faster at that time.
For now, I have configurations for:

- Kitty
- Nvim
- Tmux
- zsh
- git

If you want to setup everything, just run:
`make configure`

### Future

Maybe adding a script to install everything and set everything up with very little manual setup would be great.
